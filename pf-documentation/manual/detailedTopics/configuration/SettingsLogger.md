# Configuring logging

Play uses [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) as its logging engine, see the [Logback documentation](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html) for details on configuration.

## Default configuration
Play uses the following default configuration in production:

```xml
<configuration>
    
  <conversionRule conversionWord="coloredLevel" converterClass="play.api.Logger$ColoredLevel" />
  
  <appender name="FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender">
     <file>${application.home}/logs/application.log</file>
     <encoder>
       <pattern>%date [%level] from %logger in %thread - %message%n%xException</pattern>
     </encoder>
   </appender>

  <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
    <encoder>
      <pattern>%coloredLevel %logger{15} - %message%n%xException{10}</pattern>
    </encoder>
  </appender>
  
  <logger name="play" level="INFO" />
  <logger name="application" level="DEBUG" />
  
  <!-- Off these ones as they are annoying, and anyway we manage configuration ourself -->
  <logger name="com.avaje.ebean.config.PropertyMapLoader" level="OFF" />
  <logger name="com.avaje.ebeaninternal.server.core.XmlConfigLoader" level="OFF" />
  <logger name="com.avaje.ebeaninternal.server.lib.BackgroundThread" level="OFF" />
  <logger name="com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.javascript" level="OFF" />

  <root level="WARN">
    <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
    <appender-ref ref="FILE" />
  </root>
  
</configuration>
```

This specifies a file appender writing to `logs/application.log`, a console appender, and log levels for the root/play/application loggers.

## Configuring log levels in application.conf
You can override log levels in application.conf as follows:

```properties
# Root logger:
logger.root=ERROR

# Logger used by the framework:
logger.play=INFO

# Logger provided to your application:
logger.application=DEBUG

# Logger for a third party library
logger.org.springframework=INFO
```

> Note: To configure log levels for both parent and child paths, like `a.b` and `a.b.c`, you'll need to quote the paths. For example:
>
> ```
> logger {
>   "a.b" = WARN
>   "a.b.c" = DEBUG
> }
> ```

## Custom configuration

For any custom configuration beyond log levels, you will need to specify your own Logback configuration file.

> Note: Log level configuration in `application.conf` will also override custom configuration. It is best to remove these properties when using a Logback configuration file to avoid confusion.

### Using a configuration file from project source

You can provide a default logging configuration by providing a file called `logback.xml`.

### Using an external configuration file

You can also specify a configuration file via a System property.  This is particularly useful for production environments where the configuration file may be managed outside of your application source.

> Note: The logging system gives top preference to configuration files specified by system properties, secondly to files in the `conf` directory, and lastly to the default. This allows you to customize your application's logging configuration and still override it for specific environments or developer setups.

#### Using `-Dlogger.resource`

Specify a configuration file to be loaded from the classpath:

```
$ start -Dlogger.resource=prod-logger.xml
```

#### Using `-Dlogger.file`

Specify a configuration file to be loaded from the file system:

```
$ start -Dlogger.file=/opt/prod/logger.xml
```

### Examples

Here's an example of configuration that would work well in a production environment:

```xml
<configuration>

    <appender name="FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
        <file>${user.dir}/web/logs/application.log</file>
        <rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicy">
            <!-- Daily rollover with compression -->
            <fileNamePattern>application-log-%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.gz</fileNamePattern>
            <!-- keep 30 days worth of history -->
            <maxHistory>30</maxHistory>
        </rollingPolicy>
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%date{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss ZZZZ} [%level] from %logger in %thread - %message%n%xException</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>
    
    <appender name="ACCESS_FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
        <file>${user.dir}/web/logs/access.log</file>
        <rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicy">
            <!-- daily rollover with compression -->
            <fileNamePattern>access-log-%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.gz</fileNamePattern>
            <!-- keep 1 week worth of history -->
            <maxHistory>7</maxHistory>
        </rollingPolicy>
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%date{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss ZZZZ} %message%n</pattern>
            <!-- this quadruples logging throughput -->
            <immediateFlush>false</immediateFlush>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <!-- additivity=false ensures access log data only goes to the access log -->
    <logger name="access" level="INFO" additivity="false">
        <appender-ref ref="ACCESS_FILE" />
    </logger>
    
    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="FILE"/>
    </root>

</configuration>

```

This demonstrates a few useful features:
- It uses `RollingFileAppender` which can help manage growing log files.
- It writes log files to a directory external to the application so they aren't affected by upgrades, etc.
- The `FILE` appender uses an expanded message format that can be parsed by third party log analytics providers such as Sumo Logic.
- The `access` logger is routed to a separate log file using the `ACCESS_FILE_APPENDER`.
- All loggers are set to a threshold of `INFO` which is a common choice for production logging.  

## Akka logging configuration
Akka has its own logging system which may or may not use Play's underlying logging engine depending on how it is configured.

By default, Akka will ignore Play's logging configuration and print log messages to STDOUT using its own format. You can configure the log level in `application.conf`:

```properties
akka {
  loglevel="INFO"
}
```

To direct Akka to use Play's logging engine, you'll need to do some careful configuration. First add the following config in `application.conf`:

```properties
akka {
  loggers = ["akka.event.slf4j.Slf4jLogger"]
  loglevel="DEBUG"
}
```

A couple things to note:

- Setting `akka.loggers` to `["akka.event.slf4j.Slf4jLogger"]` will cause Akka to use Play's underlying logging engine.
- The `akka.loglevel` property sets the threshold at which Akka will forward log requests to the logging engine but does not control logging output. Once the log requests are forwarded, the Logback configuration controls log levels and appenders as normal. You should set `akka.loglevel` to the lowest threshold that you will use in Logback configuration for your Akka components.
 
Next, refine your Akka logging settings in your Logback configuration:

```xml
<!-- Set logging for all Akka library classes to INFO -->
<logger name="akka" level="INFO" />
<!-- Set a specific actor to DEBUG -->
<logger name="actors.MyActor" level="DEBUG" />
```

You may also wish to configure an appender for the Akka loggers that includes useful properties such as thread and actor address. See the logging page in the [Akka documentation](http://akka.io/docs/) for details on Logback configuration and other useful information.
