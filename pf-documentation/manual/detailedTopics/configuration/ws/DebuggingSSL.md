# Debugging SSL Connections

In the event that an HTTPS connection does not go through, debugging JSSE can be a hassle.

WS SSL provides configuration options that will turn on JSSE debug options defined in the [Debugging Utilities](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#Debug) and  [Troubleshooting Security](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/troubleshooting-security.html) pages.

To configure, set the `ws.ssl.debug` property in `application.conf`:

```
ws.ssl.debug = [
 "certpath", "ocsp",

 # "all "  # defines all of the below
 "ssl",
 "defaultctx",
 "handshake",
   "verbose",
   "data",
 "keygen",
 "keymanager",
 "pluggability",
 "record",
   "packet",
   "plaintext",
 "session",
 "sessioncache",
 "sslctx",
 "trustmanager"
]
```

> NOTE: This feature changes the setting of the `java.net.debug` system property which is global on the JVM.  In addition, this feature [changes static properties at runtime](http://tersesystems.com/2014/03/02/monkeypatching-java-classes/), and is only intended for use in development environments.

## Verbose Debugging

To see the behavior of WS, you can configuring the SLF4J logger for debug output:

```
logger.play.api.libs.ws.ssl=DEBUG
```

## Dynamic Debugging

If you are working with WSClient instances created dynamically, you can use the `SSLDebugConfig` class to set up debugging using a builder pattern:

```
val debugConfig = SSLDebugConfig().withKeyManager.withHandshake(data = true, verbose = true)
```
