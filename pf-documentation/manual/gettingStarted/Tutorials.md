# Play Tutorials

Many Activator templates come with comprehensive tutorials that guide you to creating an application using the technologies featured by that template.

A full list of templates can be discovered in the Activator UI.

Additionally, templates are also published on the Typesafe website, a full list of both official and community contributed templates for Play can be found [here](https://typesafe.com/activator/templates#filter:play).

The template directory allows you to browse templates, preview the tutorials that come with the templates, and even download self contained template bundles that allow you to get quickly started with a template.
