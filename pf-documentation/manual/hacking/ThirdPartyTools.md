Our continuous integration runs on [Cloudbees](http://www.cloudbees.com/). We not only run CI on major release and master branches, but we also perform github pull request validation using CloudBees functionality.

We are using [YourKit](http://www.yourkit.com/overview/index.jsp) for profiling our Java and Scala code. YourKit really helps us keep Play's resource usage to the minimum that you'd expect.
