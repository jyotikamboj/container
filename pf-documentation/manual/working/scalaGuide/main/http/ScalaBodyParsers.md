# Body parsers

## What is a body parser?

An HTTP PUT or POST request contains a body. This body can use any format, specified in the `Content-Type` request header. In Play, a **body parser** transforms this request body into a Scala value. 

However the request body for an HTTP request can be very large and a **body parser** can’t just wait and load the whole data set into memory before parsing it. A `BodyParser[A]` is basically an `Iteratee[Array[Byte],A]`, meaning that it receives chunks of bytes (as long as the web browser uploads some data) and computes a value of type `A` as result.

Let’s consider some examples.

- A **text** body parser could accumulate chunks of bytes into a String, and give the computed String as result (`Iteratee[Array[Byte],String]`).
- A **file** body parser could store each chunk of bytes into a local file, and give a reference to the `java.io.File` as result (`Iteratee[Array[Byte],File]`).
- A **s3** body parser could push each chunk of bytes to Amazon S3 and give a the S3 object id as result (`Iteratee[Array[Byte],S3ObjectId]`).

Additionally a **body parser** has access to the HTTP request headers before it starts parsing the request body, and has the opportunity to run some precondition checks. For example, a body parser can check that some HTTP headers are properly set, or that the user trying to upload a large file has the permission to do so.

> **Note**: That's why a body parser is not really an `Iteratee[Array[Byte],A]` but more precisely a `Iteratee[Array[Byte],Either[Result,A]]`, meaning that it has the opportunity to send directly an HTTP result itself (typically `400 BAD_REQUEST`, `412 PRECONDITION_FAILED` or `413 REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE`) if it decides that it is not able to compute a correct value for the request body

Once the body parser finishes its job and gives back a value of type `A`, the corresponding `Action` function is executed and the computed body value is passed into the request.

## More about Actions

Previously we said that an `Action` was a `Request => Result` function. This is not entirely true. Let’s have a more precise look at the `Action` trait:

@[Source-Code-Action](code/ScalaBodyParser.scala)


First we see that there is a generic type `A`, and then that an action must define a `BodyParser[A]`. With `Request[A]` being defined as:

@[Source-Code-Request](code/ScalaBodyParser.scala)


The `A` type is the type of the request body. We can use any Scala type as the request body, for example `String`, `NodeSeq`, `Array[Byte]`, `JsonValue`, or `java.io.File`, as long as we have a body parser able to process it.

To summarize, an `Action[A]` uses a `BodyParser[A]` to retrieve a value of type `A` from the HTTP request, and to build a `Request[A]` object that is passed to the action code. 

## Default body parser: AnyContent

In our previous examples we never specified a body parser. So how can it work? If you don’t specify your own body parser, Play will use the default, which processes the body as an instance of `play.api.mvc.AnyContent`.

This body parser checks the `Content-Type` header and decides what kind of body to process:

- **text/plain**: `String`
- **application/json**: `JsValue`
- **application/xml**, **text/xml** or **application/XXX+xml**: `NodeSeq`
- **application/form-url-encoded**: `Map[String, Seq[String]]`
- **multipart/form-data**: `MultipartFormData[TemporaryFile]`
- any other content type: `RawBuffer`

For example:

@[request-parse-as-text](code/ScalaBodyParser.scala)


## Specifying a body parser

The body parsers available in Play are defined in `play.api.mvc.BodyParsers.parse`.

So for example, to define an action expecting a text body (as in the previous example):

@[body-parser-text](code/ScalaBodyParser.scala)


Do you see how the code is simpler? This is because the `parse.text` body parser already sent a `400 BAD_REQUEST` response if something went wrong. We don’t have to check again in our action code, and we can safely assume that `request.body` contains the valid `String` body.

Alternatively we can use:

@[body-parser-tolerantText](code/ScalaBodyParser.scala)


This one doesn't check the `Content-Type` header and always loads the request body as a `String`.

> **Tip:** There is a `tolerant` fashion provided for all body parsers included in Play.

Here is another example, which will store the request body in a file:

@[body-parser-file](code/ScalaBodyParser.scala)

## Combining body parsers

In the previous example, all request bodies are stored in the same file. This is a bit problematic isn’t it? Let’s write another custom body parser that extracts the user name from the request Session, to give a unique file for each user:

@[body-parser-combining](code/ScalaBodyParser.scala)


> **Note:** Here we are not really writing our own BodyParser, but just combining existing ones. This is often enough and should cover most use cases. Writing a `BodyParser` from scratch is covered in the advanced topics section.

## Max content length

Text based body parsers (such as **text**, **json**, **xml** or **formUrlEncoded**) use a max content length because they have to load all the content into memory.  By default, the maximum content length that they will parse is 100KB.  It can be overridden by specifying the `parsers.text.maxLength` property in `application.conf`:

    parsers.text.maxLength=128K

For parsers that buffer content on disk, such as the raw parser or `multipart/form-data`, the maximum content length is specified using the `parsers.disk.maxLength` property, it defaults to 10MB.  The `multipart/form-data` parser also enforces the text max length property for the aggregate of the data fields.

You can also override the default maximum length for a given action:

@[body-parser-limit-text](code/ScalaBodyParser.scala)

You can also wrap any body parser with `maxLength`:

@[body-parser-limit-file](code/ScalaBodyParser.scala)
