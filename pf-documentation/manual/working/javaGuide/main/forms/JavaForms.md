# Handling form submission

## Defining a form

The `play.data` package contains several helpers to handle HTTP form data submission and validation. The easiest way to handle a form submission is to define a `play.data.Form` that wraps an existing class:

@[user](code/javaguide/forms/u1/User.java)

@[create](code/javaguide/forms/JavaForms.java)

> **Note:** The underlying binding is done using [Spring data binder](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/validation.html).

This form can generate a `User` result value from `HashMap<String,String>` data:

@[bind](code/javaguide/forms/JavaForms.java)

If you have a request available in the scope, you can bind directly from the request content:

@[bind-from-request](code/javaguide/forms/JavaForms.java)

## Defining constraints

You can define additional constraints that will be checked during the binding phase using JSR-303 (Bean Validation) annotations:

@[user](code/javaguide/forms/u2/User.java)

> **Tip:** The `play.data.validation.Constraints` class contains several built-in validation annotations.

You can also define an ad-hoc validation by adding a `validate` method to your top object:

@[user](code/javaguide/forms/u3/User.java)

The message returned in the above example will become a global error.

The `validate`-method can return the following types: `String`, `List<ValidationError>` or `Map<String,List<ValidationError>>`

`validate` method is called after checking annotation-based constraints and only if they pass.  If validation passes you must return `null` . Returning any not-`null` value (empty string or empty list) is treated as failed validation.

`List<ValidationError>` may be useful when you have additional validations for fields. For example:

@[list-validate](code/javaguide/forms/JavaForms.java)

Using `Map<String,List<ValidationError>>` is similar to `List<ValidationError>` where map's keys are error codes similar to `email` in the example above.

## Handling binding failure

Of course if you can define constraints, then you need to be able to handle the binding errors.

@[handle-errors](code/javaguide/forms/JavaForms.java)

Typically, as shown above, the form simply gets passed to a template.  Global errors can be rendered in the following way:

@[global-errors](code/javaguide/forms/view.scala.html)

Errors for a particular field can be rendered in the following manner:

@[field-errors](code/javaguide/forms/view.scala.html)


## Filling a form with initial default values

Sometimes youâ€™ll want to fill a form with existing values, typically for editing:

@[fill](code/javaguide/forms/JavaForms.java)

> **Tip:** `Form` objects are immutable - calls to methods like `bind()` and `fill()` will return a new object filled with the new data.

## Handling a form that is not related to a Model

You can use a `DynamicForm` if you need to retrieve data from an html form that is not related to a `Model` :

@[dynamic](code/javaguide/forms/JavaForms.java)

## Register a custom DataBinder

In case you want to define a mapping from a custom object to a form field string and vice versa you need to register a new Formatter for this object.
For an object like JodaTime's `LocalTime` it could look like this:

@[register-formatter](code/javaguide/forms/JavaForms.java)

When the binding fail an array of errors keys is created, the first one defined in the messages file will be used. This array will generally contain :

    ["error.invalid.<fieldName>", "error.invalid.<type>", "error.invalid"]

The errors keys are created by [Spring DefaultMessageCodesResolver](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.7.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/DefaultMessageCodesResolver.html), the root "typeMismatch" is replaced by "error.invalid".
